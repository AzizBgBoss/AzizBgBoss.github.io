            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I’m <strong>AzizBgBoss</strong>, a 16-year-old programmer from Tunisia. Programming is my passion—it’s easy and fun for me thanks to my logical mindset. I’ve got beginner to intermediate skills in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>Arduino scripting</strong>, and I’m constantly learning and improving.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m also working on my website, <a href="https://utterlink.com" target="_blank">utterlink.com</a> (still in development), and have built many hobbyist tools and small projects. If I need something to make my life easier, I just build it myself. I’ve even created simple yet effective AI bots for tasks like puzzle-solving.
            </p>

            <i><b>Let's be realistic</b>—a kid asking to be paid with crypto or gift cards might sound sketchy at first,</i> and I completely understand your concern, especially given the association between scams and cryptocurrencies. However, as a 16-year-old, I currently don't have access to credit cards, and platforms like PayPal or Cash App aren't easy to use in my country. Crypto, on the other hand, offers flexibility for international clients and comes with lower transaction fees. To ensure trust, I always provide a preview of the product before payment so you can be confident you're getting what you paid for. If you're still uncomfortable with this payment method, we can discuss alternatives in special cases to find a solution that works for both of us.

        <section id="why-not-ai">
            <h2>Why not choose AI instead?</h2>
            While AI can generate code and provide explanations exceptionally well, it struggles to adapt seamlessly to a client’s unique working environment, whether physical or digital. One advantage of working with a human is accountability; I take full responsibility for my work, unlike AI. Additionally, humans can easily assess and integrate solutions by analyzing the specific context. For example, if a client shares a picture of a project, I can offer tailored advice and insights based on what I see. Similarly, if a client wants to integrate code into an existing project, I can identify the necessary modifications, understand the structure, and test the outcome—eliminating the need for trial and error on their part. AI still has a long way to go before it can handle these tasks efficiently. This gap gives me an opportunity to expand my expertise, enhance my projects, and work toward securing even better opportunities.
